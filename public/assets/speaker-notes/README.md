# Speaker Notes PDF

## IMPORTANT: Please place the speaker notes PDF file here

The "Download Speaker Notes (PDF)" button is visible on the website, but the file is currently missing.

### To fix:

1. **Copy your PDF file** to this location:
   - **File name**: `RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf`
   - **Full path**: `public/assets/speaker-notes/RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf`

2. **If copying from `/mnt/data/RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf`**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the file to the correct location
   cp /mnt/data/RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf public/assets/speaker-notes/RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf
   ```

3. **Or manually**:
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\DELL\presentation\public\assets\speaker-notes\`
   - Place your `RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf` file in this folder

### Verification:

After placing the file, the download button will work automatically. The button links to `/assets/speaker-notes/RoadSafetyNotes2.pdf` which maps to this location.
